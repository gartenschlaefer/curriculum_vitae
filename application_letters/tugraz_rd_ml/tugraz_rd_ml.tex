\mySubTitle{Dear Dr. Ranftl and Dr. Badeli,}\\\\
I would like to apply for the position as R\&D Engineer/Researcher Machine Learning (ML) in your project of classifying cardiovascular pathologies.

My main motivation for this application is that I am quite interested to use my ML experiences in a meaningful project that might once help people.
Moreover, the possibility to work part-time is a great opportunity for me to have enough time to settle in Graz again and to follow other projects that come along my way.

Until now my main interest was in speech recognition, in detail Keyword Spotting (KWS), where I did my Master's thesis in. There I developed a small video game that is able to process speech commands to actual commands in the game. I therefore have a very good background in Python and Pytorch.

As I already have a MSc. degree, I do not consider me as entry level and certainly will not write a Master's thesis but I am happy to contribute to scientific outputs of the project. If that is not a problem, I am happy if you consider my application.\\

\mySubTitle{Sincerely,}\\\\ Christian Walter
