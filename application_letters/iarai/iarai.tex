\mySubTitle{Dear Ladies and Gentlemen,}\\\\
I am happy to apply for the open internship position of traffic forecast modelling and simulation in your research institute.
I believe that I fulfill all your requirements for this position as I posses much experience with neural networks and the use of the Pytorch framework.
My Master's Thesis is \enquote{Keyword Spotting for video games with neural networks}, where I used resource efficient neural network models and a exploration of Generative Adversarial Neural Networks (GANs).
Also my background in game development is very useful in simulation tasks.

Moreover, I am quite interested in optimal solutions for traffic problems because of their immense impact in climate change and the life standard improvements of inhabitants.
Personally, I would be quite thrilled by learning more about how to shape a city or highway in order to enhance its efficiency in transport.

Please, if you feel that I fit your requirements, do not hesitate to contact me.\\

\mySubTitle{Sincerely,}\\\\ Christian Walter
