\mySubTitle{Dear Sir or Madam,}
\\ \\
I would like to apply for the open position as Game Play Programmer in your company.\\\\
\headParam{About my Game Dev history}
\\
I got into Game Dev in 2016. In this year I found courage to join my first Game Jam. Since then I was fascinated by creating games in small teams and so less time. I used closely every possibility of joining Game Jams in Graz and attended the Game Dev courses my university offered. I loved, to get to know new people, the challenging of creating a new game idea and my constantly increasing skills. Usually I was the one who did the sounds, since most of the people know less about it. I attended a free blender course at my university, held by my dear colleague Thomas Brunner, to get to know more about 3D modeling. Up to now I achieved a good overview in Game Dev.\\

\headParam{Why I am applying for this job}
\\
I want to further increase my Game Dev skills in a professional way. The idea of being an Indie Developer is too lonely and depressing for me. Besides I like to work together with other people on great game ideas in a friendly environment. I am currently finishing my B.Sc Studies for Electrical and Sound Engineer. Because of this and another part-time job, I am working now for some years, I must apply for this position as part-time job with 20-30h per week. Hopefully this is not too less working hours for this position. \\

\headParam{About your requirements for this position}
\\
During my time as electrical control engineer and my experiences in creating software and hardware applications, I can consider myself a problem solver. I am used to programming for years and had an excellent university course project in C++. I got some python skills from my interest in Machine Learning and my Bachelor thesis in YouTube video sound classification with recurrent neural networks. I always prefer working in teams, since it is far more fun and motivating. I played video games since I was a kid and love challenging ones, but must admit that university takes most of my gaming time. Through my technical studies I need to be good at math and English become quite natural to me since my exchange semester in Finland. I believe I have enough experiences in Unity, but never used the UE4 game engine. 

\headParam{What I am expecting}
\\
A lovely gaming studio with nice people in an friendly working environment. An open company culture with flexible working times. And last but not least, an excellent coffee machine.
\\ \\
\mySubTitle{Sincerely,}\\\\ Christian Walter
